Puppet Concat Module
====================

This is a module that provides a native type for performing multi-part file
concatenation, generally referred to by the [Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com) team as the File
Fragment Pattern.

The concept is based on ideas that R.I. Pienaar describes on his [Building
files from fragments in Puppet](http://www.devco.net/archives/2010/02/19/building_files_from_fragments_with_puppet.php) page.

Deprecation warning
-------------------

This module is deprecated in favour of [puppetlabs-concat](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/concat)
2.0.0 or higher.

It used to be a better alternative than the 1.x series by being implemented as
a native type instead of shell scripts, but 2.x rewrote concat as native types.
theforeman modules will be updated to use puppetlabs-concat and this module
will not be maintained.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install this package is either through the Puppet module
manager or via RPM. A spec file has been included that can be used to create an
RPM if required.

This module is known to be compatible with Puppet 2.6.

Basic Usage
-----------

This module has been designed to be quite flexible but follows the basic
pattern of specifying file fragments and subsequently building a target file. 

See the comments in the code for the definition of all options.

    concat_build { "identifier":
      order => ['*.tmp'],
      target => '/tmp/test'
    }

    concat_fragment { "identifier+01.tmp":
      content => "Some random stuff"
    }

    concat_fragment { "identifier+02.tmp":
      content => "Some other random stuff"
    }

Appending without newlines
--------------------------

If, for example, you wanted your fragments to join together to be a
comma-separated list, you can achieve this by doing:

    concat_build { "identifier":
      order => ['*.tmp'],
      target => '/tmp/test',
      file_delimiter => ",",
      append_newline => false
    }

Chained Builds
--------------

There are times where you're going to want to chain multiple concat fragment
builds into a single entity. Multi-part or INI-style files is generally where
this comes into play.

An example of this type of build is as follows:

    concat_build { "identifier":
      order => ['*.tmp'],
      target => '/tmp/test'
    }
    
    concat_fragment { "identifier+01.tmp":
      content => "Some random stuff"
    }
    
    concat_fragment { "identifier+02.tmp":
      content => "Some other random stuff"
    }
    
    concat_build { "subtest":
      parent_build => "identifier",
      target => "/var/lib/puppet/concat_native/fragments/identifier/subtest.tmp"
    }
    
    concat_fragment { "subtest+sub1":
      content => "Sub-build stuff"
    }
    
    concat_fragment { "subtest+sub2":
      content => "More sub-build stuff"
    }

Notes
-----

Concat fragments are stored under Puppet[:vardir]/concat_native/fragments.
