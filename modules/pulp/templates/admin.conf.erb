# host:
#   The pulp server hostname
# port:
#   The port providing the RESTful API
# rsa_pub:
#   The pulp server public key used for authentication.
# api_prefix:
#   The REST API prefix.
# verify_ssl:
#   Set this to False to configure the client not to verify that the server's SSL cert is signed by
#   a trusted authority
#   WARNING: Setting this to False is not safe if you wish to use Pulp with real passwords or
#            any other private information. It is strongly recommended to keep this set to True, and
#            to use certificates that are signed by a trusted authority on the web server that
#            serves Pulp.
# ca_path:
#   This is a path to a file of concatenated trusted CA certificates, or to a directory of trusted
#   CA certificates (with openssl-style hashed symlinks, one certificate per file).
